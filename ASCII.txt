### Assigning initial parameters

alpha_value = 0.01 #Learning rate
# Previosly Experimented with the learning rate=0.1 which resulted into fast model adaption 
    # while when we set the learning rate =0.001,it slow down the algorithm learning

T_min_portion_background = 0.7 # Threshold value for background accountation
# T parameter determines sensitivity of the algorithm in detecting changes in video frames. 
# If we setting T to 0.1(just for comparison), we're getting false detection of moving object
# because most of the objects in the background are becoming part of foreground.
# If we set T to high as 0.9, 90% of the frame will be the part of the background and we're getting wrong detection.


K = 3 # No. of Gaussians(Taking 3 because for gray level it is the best no. of gaussian(by experimentation) and less no. of gaussians will also reduce the complexity of algorithm as we 
# we're computing all the parameters for each frame corresponding to each gaussian)
w =0.30, 0.35, 0.35 # Prior probability for all 3 gaussians with summation=1
covariance = 5 # (Defining low initially)
# If the variance is too high then the ratio w/sigma will low , in that case most of the objects will be the part of the forground, and if variance is too low in that case the ratio w/sigma will be high in that case most of the objects will be considered as background object.
